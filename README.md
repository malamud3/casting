# LoginVR Quest¬†Caster¬†

A lightweight **Python¬†+¬†Tkinter** desktop launcher that makes mirroring your **Meta‚ÄØQuest‚ÄØ2** headset¬†to a Windows PC a one‚Äëclick task.¬†Under the hood it simply drives¬†ADB and [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy), but it adds quality‚Äëof‚Äëlife features such as colour‚Äëcoded connection status, auto‚Äërefresh, and built‚Äëin help.

| ¬†Component                      | ¬†Why¬†you need it                                                                                                          |

## üìÇ¬†Folder layout (in‚Äërepo)

```text
casting/
‚îú‚îÄ main.py            ‚Üê¬†Tkinter GUI
‚îú‚îÄ src/               ‚Üê¬†Runtime resources kept as‚Äëis inside the EXE
‚îÇ¬†¬†‚îú‚îÄ adb.exe
‚îÇ¬†¬†‚îú‚îÄ scrcpy.exe
‚îÇ¬†¬†‚îú‚îÄ cast.bat
‚îÇ¬†¬†‚îî‚îÄ icon.ico
‚îî‚îÄ README.md
```

The application always looks for resources relative to¬†`src/`, both when run from source *and* when packed.

---

## üöÄ¬†Running from source

```bash
# clone & cd into repo
git clone https://github.com/Avi-Kohen/casting.git
cd casting

python -m venv .venv && .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # (optional)
pip install -r requirements.txt                      # tkinter is in stdlib
python main.py                                       # launch the GUI
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è¬†Building a portable EXE

pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --add-data "src;src" --icon src/temp.ico main.py

```bash
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile \
  --add-data "src;src" \
  --icon src/icon.ico \
  main.py
```

The resulting `dist/main.exe` contains **everything**, including the `src/` folder, so you can copy the single file to any Windows¬†10/11 PC.

---

## üìñ¬†Usage

1. **Enable developer mode** in the Quest mobile app.
2. Plug the headset into your PC with a data‚Äëcapable USB‚ÄëC cable.
3. Put the headset on ‚Äë> **Allow USB debugging**.
4. Start *Quest¬†2 Caster* ‚Üí indicator turns **Green**.
5. Click **Cast¬†Screen** ‚Üí scrcpy launches with the crop, bitrate, and codec you set in¬†`cast.bat`.

If the circle stays **Yellow**, you haven‚Äôt accepted the USB‚Äëdebug prompt yet.
